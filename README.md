GPG encrypted communications utilizing software defined radio.

#Why

Sending encrypted information can be very helpful.  But how would one send encrypted information without IP?  Why not leverage naturally occurring phenomenon?  That's where this idea came from. The goal is to be able to send and receive GPG encrypted information via Radio Frequency to be able to communicate with those who cannot utilize IP.
